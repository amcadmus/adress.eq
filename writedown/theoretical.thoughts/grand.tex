\begin{abstract}
  In this work, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis, supported by numerical tests, of the
  reliability of the adaptive resolution simulation (AdResS) technique in sampling the Grand Canonical
  ensemble. We demonstrate that the correct density and radial distribution
  functions in the hybrid region, where molecules change resolution, are two necessary conditions for
  considering the atomistic and coarse-grained regions in AdResS equivalent to subsystems
  of a full atomistic system with an accuracy up to the second order with respect to the probability distribution of the system. Moreover, we show that the
  work done by a thermodynamic force in the transition region, that is a force derived on the basis of empirical thermodynamic considerations, is formally equivalent to level the chemical
  potential difference between the different resolutions. From these results follows the main conclusion that, the atomistic region exchanges
  molecules with the coarse-grained region in a Grand Canonical
  fashion with an accuracy up to (at least) the second order. Numerical tests, for the relevant case of liquid water at ambient conditions, are carried on to strengthen the conclusions of the theoretical analysis.
  This fruitful combination of theoretical principles and numerical evidence candidates the adaptive resolution technique as a natural, general and efficient protocol for Grand Canonical Molecular Dynamics for the case of large systems.

\section{Introduction}
The Adaptive Resolution Simulation (AdResS) scheme~\cite{jcp,pre} is a
method that in a concurrent fashion simulates a molecular system treated with different
resolutions in different regions of space.  The word ``resolution''
here refers to the amount of details included in a molecular model: usually, the higher the
resolution is, the more precise is the model, and the higher the corresponding computational cost.  The advantage is obvious, it
keeps track of both: the local fine-grained processes in the
high-resolution regions and the large scale behavior, requiring a less demanding computational effort compared to the system that, as a
whole, would be described by the high-resolution model. The key feature of
AdResS is that it allows an on-the-fly change of resolution when a
molecule travels from a high-resolution region to a low-resolution
region and vice versa. Moreover, recent research~\cite{prlgc, rdfcorr}
has numerically demonstrated that different regions (with different resolutions) reach a
thermodynamic equilibrium as if the whole system is equilibrated
under the high-resolution description. Therefore, one is tempted to state that a region with a
certain resolution exchanges molecules with the rest of the system in
a Grand Canonical fashion. This work, from the theoretical point of
view, studies the minimal necessary conditions, such that AdResS
performs effective Grand Canonical simulations.  
Moreover, we shed light on the level accuracy of
the sampling in a Grand Canonical fashion; it will be shown that indeed the sampling can be considered 
of the Grand Canonical type if we accept an accuracy on the probability distribution of the system up to the second order (in its moments expansion).
Though the second order is numerically satisfying, higher level of accuracy can be systematically reached by requiring to match in the transition region higher moments of the probability distribution.
From the numerical point of view, for systems which are large enough, a (relatively) small subsystem of a full atomistic region is a 
natural Grand Canonical ensemble, for this reason the approach we use here is that of showing the equivalence between the atomistic region of AdResS and the same region in a full atomistic simulation.
Extensive numerical tests, for the relevant case of liquid water at ambient conditions, are presented in order to show that the hypothesis done within the theoretical analysis are justified from the numerical point of view. Beyond our expectations, we have found that in the atomistic region of AdResS not only the accuracy can be tuned up to the second order, but, without any additional correction, even the three body correlation function of molecular centers of mass turns out to be the same as that of a full atomistic simulation. Finally, a further numerical test was carried on: the coarse-grained molecules are substituted by a liquid of spheres interacting via the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA)  potential \cite{wca} which have no reference to the atomistic resolution. We show that also in this case in the atomistic region, due to the work of the filter of the transition region, an accuracy up to the third order in the probability distribution is achieved.
The results of this work allow us to make a step further in the possibility of employing the AdResS scheme as a natural, general numerical protocol for truly Grand Canonical Molecular Dynamics simulations
independently from the nature of the particles acting as a reservoir in the coarse-grained region. The word {\it ``natural''} refers to the fact  that strictly speaking in statistical mechanics the Grand Canonical ensemble is defined in operative terms as a subsystem of an infinitely large system. Of course in simulation systems are never infinitely large, however they can well be large enough to numerically satisfy this condition. In this sense, in our approach molecules are exchanged in straightforward dynamical way without requiring the a priori knowledge of the chemical potential or the definition of additional coupling variables, as it is the case of previous numerical schemes \cite{pet1,pet2,pet3,pet4,pet5,flo}.
The paper is organized as follows: first we briefly describe the essential principles on which AdResS is based, then we discuss the approximations under which one can write the probability distribution of the system in terms of Grand Canonical partition function. Next we show that the thermodynamic force balances the difference in chemical potential; this idea allows us to derive the necessary conditions of simulation to reach the accuracy in terms of moments of the probability distribution of the system. 
Finally the numerical results are discussed.

\section{A brief description of the AdResS scheme}

In this work, the higher resolution refers to the atomistic
description (AT) of a molecule, while the lower resolution refers to
its corresponding coarse-grained (CG) model (for a pictorial representation of a typical AdResS set up, see Fig.\ref{fig:adress-water} for the case of liquid water).  We assume that the dynamics of the
system is subject to the Langevin equation, which is the thermostat
usually used in the AdResS simulations:
\begin{align}
  \dd d\vect r_i &= \vect v_i\dd dt\\
  m_i\dd d\vect v_i &= (-m_i\xi_i\vect v_i + \vect F_i)\,\dd dt + \sqrt{2\sigma_i}\;\dd d\vect W_t
\end{align}
where $\xi_i$ are friction coefficients,
$m_i$ are the mass of atoms, $\sigma_i = k_BTm_i\xi_i$ with $T$ being
the temperature, and
$\dd d\vect W_t$ is the standard Wiener process. We denote the
phase space variable $\vect x = \{\vect r_i, \vect v_i\}$; $\vect r_i,
\vect v_i$ are the degrees of freedoms (DOFs) of the system.  If the
system is conservative, namely $\vect F_i = -\nabla_{\vect r_i}U$,
then one obtains the equilibrium density distribution $p(\vect
x)\propto e^{-\beta\mathcal H(\vect x)}$, where $\beta = 1/k_BT$ is the inverse temperature. In the AdResS scheme,
different resolutions in the system are described by a weighting
function of position $w(\vect r)$. Usually the higher resolutions is
denoted by $w = 1$, while the lower resolution is denoted by $w = 0$.
Between the higher and lower resolutions, a hybrid region allows a 
molecule to have both (interpolated) resolutions. The weighting function changes smoothly
from 0 to 1, and one possible weighting function is:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:new-w}
  w(\vect r) =
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{lcl}
      1 &\quad& \chi < 0\\
      1  && 0 < \chi < r_c\\
      \cos^2\big[\frac{\pi}{2(d_{\HY} - r_c)} (\chi - d_{\textrm{ex}} - r_c)\big] && r_c < \chi < d_{\HY} \\
      0 &&  d_{\HY}  < \chi.
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{align}
Where $\chi$ is the distance to the boundary of the higher resolution
region, $\chi < 0$ means that the molecule is in the higher resolution
region, $d_{\HY}$ is the thickness of the hybrid region, $r_c$ is the
cut-off radius of the atomistic interactions.  The intermolecular force is modeled by the following
interpolation formula \cite{rdfcorr}:
\begin{align}
  \vect F_{\alpha\beta} =
  w_\alpha w_\beta\vect F^{\AT}_{\alpha\beta} +
  (1-w_\alpha w_\beta)\vect F^{\CG}_{\alpha\beta} +
  w_\alpha w_\beta (1-w_\alpha w_\beta)\vect F_{\alpha\beta}^{\rdf}.
\label{grf}
\end{align}
Where $ \vect F^{\AT}_{\alpha\beta}$, $ \vect F^{\CG}_{\alpha\beta}$
are the intermolecular interaction of the atomistic and coarse-grained
resolutions, respectively.  $\vect F_{\alpha\beta}^{\rdf}$ is a force that corrects the center of mass - center of mass radial distribution function (RDF) in the transition region $\Delta$ ~\cite{rdfcorr}. A further one body force, named thermodynamic force, ${\vect F}^{\textrm{th}}$, is applied to ensure the correct thermodynamic equilibrium of the system:
\begin{equation}
  {\vect F}_{\alpha}=
  \sum_{\beta}{\vect F}_{\alpha\beta}+
  {\vect F}^{\textrm{th}}(\vect r_\alpha).
\label{mody}
\end{equation}
which is defined by
\begin{equation}
  p_{\AT}+
  \rho_0
  \int_{\Delta} {\vect F}^\text{th}(\vect r)\,\dd d\vect r
  =p_{\CG}
  \label{thf}
\end{equation}
where $p_{\AT}$ is the pressure of the atomistic resolution, $p_{\CG}$ that of the coarse-grained resolution, $\rho_{0}$ is the equilibrium number density, corresponding to that of a full atomistic simulation.
Such a thermodynamic force has been derived by empirical considerations regarding the equilibrium of open systems and is based on {\it forcing} the equality of the grand potential of the atomistic part with the rest of the system.
This is then reduced to provide a balancing force to the difference of pressure at the wished uniform density of equilibrium. Regarding to this point, we will show that the thermodynamic force derived in this way, corresponds also to a force that balances the difference in chemical potential between the different regions. As a consequence (equilibrium of the chemical potential) the interpretation of the AdResS simulation as a Grand Canonical sampling is enforced even further.
For specific details, see Ref.~\cite{prlgc}. A crucial point of this work is the following: the 
AdResS scheme is not Hamiltonian~\cite{presolo,prlcomm}; however, under the hypothesis of instantaneously
freezing the DOFs in the hybrid region, the atomistic and
coarse-grained regions can be considered (in good approximation) Hamiltonian; this line of thought gives rise to the basic
idea of the present study.

\section{Theoretical considerations}
\subsection{The outline of the basic idea}
Here we denote the degrees of freedoms and number of particles in the
atomistic region (AT), hybrid region ($\HY$) and the coarse-grained
region (CG) by $(\vect x_1, N_1)$, $(\vect x_2, N_2)$ and $(\vect x_3,
N_3)$, respectively. Therefore, the target is to prove that the atomistic
region is subject to the Grand Canonical statistics: 
\begin{align}\label{eqn:p}
  p(\vect x_1, N_1) = \frac{1}{\mathcal Q_1}
  e^{\beta\mu_{\AT} N_1 - \beta \mathcal H_{N_1}^{\AT}(\vect x_1)} 
\end{align}
where the partition function $\mathcal Q_1$ is defined by
\begin{align}
  \mathcal Q_1 =
  \sum_{N_1}\int
  \dd d\vect x_1\,
  e^{\beta\mu_{\AT} N_1 - \beta \mathcal H_{N_1}^{\AT}(\vect x_1)}
\end{align}
The marginal probability of finding $N_1$ molecules in the
AT region is:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:p-2}
  p(N_1) = \int\dd d\vect x_1\, p(\vect x_1, N_1)
  =
  \frac{1}{\mathcal Q_1}e^{\beta\mu_{AT} N_1}Q_{N_1}
\end{align}
where $Q_{N_1}$ is the partition function for a canonical ensemble
with $N_1$ atomistic molecules:
\begin{align}
  Q_{N_1}  =
  \int\dd d\vect x_1\,
  e^{ - \beta \mathcal H_{N_1}^{\AT}(\vect x_1)}
\end{align}
Let us consider:
\begin{align}
  p(\vect x_1, N_1) = p(\vect x_1 | N_1)\,p(N_1)
\end{align}
Rigorously speaking, for a truly Grand Canonical ensemble,
the conditional probability $p(\vect x_1 | N_1)$ 
should be
\begin{align}\label{eqn:p-1}
  p(\vect x_1 | N_1) &= \frac{1}{Q_{N_1}} e^{-\beta \mathcal H_{N_1}^{AT}(\vect x_1)} \end{align}
The key point of our argumentation is the following: we want to compare
the distributions (in the various regions) of the AdResS simulation
with the corresponding ones of a full atomistic reference system, which is ideally divided
in subregions corresponding to the AT, $\HY$ and CG regions of the AdResS
set up. The first step in our procedure is to fix the number of molecules in the atomistic
region and consider the conditional probability $p(\vect x_1 |
N_1)$. If the AdResS set up, would sample in a Grand Canonical fashion, then this
probability should be the same as the corresponding one of a full
atomistic reference system, namely Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:p-1}.  Then, if the
probability of finding $N_1$ molecules in the atomistic region is also
the same as the full atomistic reference system, namely
Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:p-2}, we can safely state that the atomistic region of AdResS
samples configurations in a Grand Canonical fashion. In fact as underlined before, it must be noticed that a subsystem of full atomistic system is a natural Grand Canonical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit. 
The thermodynamic limit in our case is intended in such a way that at a fixed density, the size of
  both the AT and CG regions tend to infinite, and, at the same time,
  the ratio between the extension of AT and that of the CG regions goes tends to zero; as underlined before, in practical terms, in numerical simulation the system size does not go to infinity, however it can be large enough so that within a certain numerical accuracy the hypothesis of thermodynamic limit holds.

\subsection{The probability $p(\vect x_1 | N_1)$}
\label{sec:p-1}
To prove the statement above, the probability $p(\vect x_1 | N_1)$ is divided into two parts:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:divide-cond-p}
  p(\vect x_1 | N_1) = \sum_{N_2}\int
  p(\vect x_1 | N_1; \vect x_2, N_2) \,
  p(\vect x_2, N_2 | N_1)
  \,\dd d\vect x_2
\end{align}
$p(\vect x_1 | N_1; \vect x_2, N_2)$ is the probability obtained by fixing the
coordinates and number of particles in the region $\HY$ and considering
the distribution of the DOFs in the AT region.
%As we have shown before,
  If we use the weighting function given by Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:new-w},
and assume the AT and $\HY$ regions are short-range correlated,
the probability can be approximated by:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:p-1-1}
  p(\vect x_1 | N_1; \vect x_2, N_2)
  \propto &\,
  e^{-\beta\mathcal H_{N_1}^{\AT}(\vect x_1; \vect x_2, N_2)}
\end{align}
with an atomistic Hamiltonian:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:p-1-2}
  \mathcal H_{N_1}^{{\AT}}(\vect x_1; \vect x_2, N_2) = &\,
  \sum_{j=1}^{N_1}\frac12 m_i\vect v_i^2 + 
  \sum_{i,j=1}^{N_1}\frac12 U^{{\AT}}(\vect r_i - \vect r_j)  +
  \sum_{i=1}^{N_1}\sum_{j=N_1+1}^{N_2} U^{{\AT}}(\vect r_i - \vect r_j)   
\end{align}
which is exactly the same as for the equivalent subregion of the full atomistic system of reference.
Here are some remarks on this argument:
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep -1pt
\item All interactions in the system are short-ranged with given cut-offs (the
  electrostatic interaction is treated by the reaction field method),
  so that the AT region does NOT interact in a direct way with the CG region.
    Moreover, at least for the case of liquid water at ambient conditions, we will show with numerical tests that the hypothesis of short-range correlation is justified.
\item The number of molecules and their coordinates are assumed to be
  fixed in the $\HY$ region.  Under this assumption, we firstly study
  the conditional probability $p(\vect x_1 | N_1; \vect x_2, N_2)$ of
  the AT region embedded in the fixed $\HY$ environment, and then count
  all possible realizations of configurations in the $\HY$ region, which is subject to
  the distribution $p(\vect x_2, N_2 | N_1)$.
  Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:divide-cond-p} validates this two-stage approach of
  investigating $p(\vect x_1 | N_1)$.
\item Due to the point 2, correlations between the molecules
  in $\HY$ and CG regions are not relevant in our argument, in fact
  the DOFs in the $\HY$ region are anyway considered instantaneously fixed while sampling configurations in the AT and CG regions.
While this would not be correct if we consider dynamic properties, it is instead correct if we look only at the sampling of configurations. For this, two ingredients are required (a) molecules in the AT region do not interact in a direct way with those in the CG region (as stated above) and (b) at the same time, in the transition region, we sample over all possible (fixed) configurations of $N_{2}$ in $p(\vect x_2, N_2 | N_1)$. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
At this point, the key question is whether the probability in the $\HY$ region, $p(\vect
x_2, N_2 | N_1)$ is the same as that of the equivalent region in a full atomistic reference
system. In general this seems not be the case, but it is possible to
derive necessary conditions to enforce such an equivalence in terms of order of expansion of the probability of the system in terms of its moments; the lowest orders involve
the marginal distribution functions \cite{rdfcorr}:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:p-1-cond1}
  \rho_{\HY}(\vect r) &= \rho_{\AT}(\vect r)\\\label{eqn:p-1-cond2}
  g_{\HY}( r) &= g_{\AT}(r)
\end{align}
The first order marginal distribution is the particle (or molecular) density 
$\rho_{\HY}(\vect r)$, while the second order marginal distribution is
the radial distribution function (RDF), $g_{\HY}(r)$. 
The necessary
conditions of the correct distribution $p(\vect x_1|N_1)$
are that these two distributions should be the same as those of the fully atomistic reference system. 
These are the minimal necessary conditions involving the basic DOF's, that is the molecular center of mass coordinates, however one may require a more specific accuracy by imposing that also any atom-atom $g(r)$ is matched to the corresponding function of the atomistic reference system. 
In general, the conditions of Eq.\ref{eqn:p-1-cond1} and Eq.\ref{eqn:p-1-cond2} would assure that at least at the first and second order $p(\vect x_2, N_2 | N_1)$ in the AdResS is the same as that of a full atomistic simulation. One needs to go at least at the second order, so that at the interface between the atomistic and transition region, the radial distribution functions of the atomistic part are not affected by artifact due to the deviation of the RDF's of the hybrid region from the correct atomistic reference. 
We have shown numerically how the RDF correction, can be numerically implemented~\cite{rdfcorr}.
Higher accuracy can be then systematically reached by enforcing the equivalence of higher moments of the distribution in the transition region.
Next, we must show that $p(N_{1})$ is the same in AdResS and in the reference full atomistic simulation. The basic outline of arguments will be given in a following section while the (long) explicit calculations are reported in the Appendix, however, before proceeding further we must first treat a key ingredient of this equivalence, that is the thermodynamic force. This force, in fact, is the crucial tool for assuring the thermodynamic and statistical equilibrium of the AdResS system when compared to the reference full atomistic simulation. In the next section, we will show how this force, derived on intuitive ground to enforce the equality of some basic thermodynamic relations, as shown in Eq.\ref{thf}, is in fact formally equivalent to introduce the balance of chemical potential between the various region at the desired density of equilibrium. The balance of chemical potential is implicitly a strong argument in favor of the idea of AdResS as Grand Canonical-like scheme (i.e. molecules are exchanged between the AT and CG region in conditions of equilibrium). 


\subsection{Thermodynamic force: from empirical intuition to strict formalization within the Grand Canonical framework}
Intuitive thermodynamic considerations led to formula \eqref{thf}. In this section we show that, despite the argument used in Eq.\ref{thf} from Refs.\cite{prlgc,rdfcorr} has a strong empirical component, one can formally justify this force
as a tool to balance the chemical potential of the various resolutions and, as a consequence,  a key aspect in interpreting AdResS as an effective Grand Canonical set up.

  \caption{Schematic plot of the AdResS system in thermodynamic equilibrium. The thickness of the filter corresponds to $d_{\Delta}$.}
  \label{fig:tmp1}
\end{figure}
Here, two assumptions are made:
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep -1pt
\item $N_2\ {\ll}\ N_1 \ll N_3$: the second inequality corresponds to
  the thermodynamic limit of the Grand Canonical ensemble. The first
  one actually assumes that the $\HY$ region is infinitely thin so that it
  can be viewed as an infinitesimal membrane that allows free exchange of molecules from
  the AT region to the CG region and vice versa.
\item We now define a supplementary Hamiltonian:
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal H(\vect x_1, N_1; \vect x_3, N_3) =
    \mathcal H_{N_1}^{\AT}(\vect x_1) + \mathcal H_{N_3}^{\CG}(\vect x_3); 
  \end{equation}
  The condition above is true, in the thermodynamic limit, if the system is
  short-range correlated.
\end{enumerate}
The equilibrium in the AT and CG region is assured by the membrane $\HY$ via the thermodynamic force. Conceptually, we assume there is an infinitely thin
``filter'' (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp1}) located at the interface between
the AT and CG regions. When a molecule travels from the CG region to
the AT region, the filter does some work $\omega_0$ on the system in order to assure the thermodynamic equilibrium between the AT and CG region.
Therefore, we add an empirical term in the Hamiltonian of the system
$N_1\omega_0$, related to the work done  by the filter. 
Having fixed the number of molecules in the three regions, and by following the
arguments of the last section, both the AT and the CG regions are
subject to the Boltzmann distribution.
Thus, the fixed-number partition function ($N_1$ in the AT region and $N_3$ in the CG region) of the system reads
\begin{align}\nonumber
  q(N,V,T)
  &= \frac1{N!}\int
  \dd d\vect x
  e^{-\beta
    [\mathcal H(\vect x_1, N_1; \vect x_3, N_3) +
    N_1\omega_0]}\\\nonumber
  &= \frac1{N!}\int
  \dd d\vect x_1\dd d\vect x_3\,
  e^{-\beta
    [\mathcal H_{N_1}^{\AT}(\vect x_1) +
    \mathcal H_{N_3}^{\CG}(\vect x_3) +
    N_1\omega_0]}\\\nonumber
  & = \frac{N_1!N_3!}{N!}
  e^{-\beta N_1\omega_0}
  \frac{1}{N_1!}\int\dd d\vect x_1 e^{-\beta\mathcal H_{N_1}^{\AT}(\vect x_1)}
  \frac{1}{N_3!}\int\dd d\vect x_3 e^{-\beta\mathcal H_{N_3}^{\CG}(\vect x_3)}\\
  & = \frac{N_1!N_3!}{N!}
  e^{-\beta N_1\omega_0}
  Q_{\AT}(N_1, V_1, T)\,
  Q_{\CG}(N_3, V_3, T) 
\end{align}
Considering the permutations of particles, the number of possibilities of
$N_1$ molecules being in the atomistic region and $N_3$ molecules being
in the coarse-grained region is  $\frac{N!}{N_1!N_3!}$.
Therefore, the partition function of the whole system reads
\begin{align}\nonumber
  Q(N,V,T) &= \sum_{N_1=1}^N
  \frac{N!}{N_1!N_3!} \frac{N_1!N_3!}{N!}
  e^{-\beta N_1\omega_0}
  Q_{\AT}(N_1, V_1, T)\,
  Q_{\CG}(N_3, V_3, T) \\
  &= \sum_{N_1=1}^N
  e^{-\beta N_1\omega_0}
  Q_{\AT}(N_1, V_1, T)\,
  Q_{\CG}(N_3, V_3, T) 
\end{align}
with natural relations:
\begin{align}
  N &= N_1 + N_3\\
  V &= V_1 + V_3
\end{align}
% The following approach can be found in, for example,
% Ref.~\cite{tuckeman2010statistical}.
First, for convenience, we denote that
\begin{align}
  \tilde q_{N_1} = 
  e^{-\beta N_1\omega_0}
  Q_{\AT}(N_1, V_1, T)\,
  Q_{\CG}(N - N_1, V_3, T),
\end{align}
and $\bar N_1$ is the value at which $\tilde q_{N_1}$ reaches
its maximum, namely $\tilde q_{\bar N_1} = \max \tilde q_{N_1}$.
Since $\tilde q_{N_1}$ is positive definite, a basic
observation is that
\begin{align}
  \tilde q_{\bar N_1}
  \leq
  \sum_{N_1=1}^N \tilde q_{N_1}
  \leq
  N \tilde q_{\bar N_1}. 
\end{align}
Due to the monotonicity of the logarithm, we have
\begin{align}
  \ln\tilde q_{\bar N_1}
  \leq
  \ln\sum_{N_1=1}^N \tilde q_{N_1}
  \leq
  \ln (N \tilde q_{\bar N_1})
  =
  \ln N + \ln\tilde q_{\bar N_1}.
\end{align}
If $\ln N \ll \ln \tilde q_{\bar N_1}$ (the validity will be discussed
later), then 
\begin{align}
  \ln\sum_{N_1=1}^N \tilde q_{N_1}
  \approx
  \ln\tilde q_{\bar N_1},
\end{align}
which is
\begin{align}
  \ln Q(N, V, T)
  \approx
  -\beta \bar N_1\omega_0 + 
  \ln Q_{\AT}(\bar N_1, V_1, T) + \ln Q_{\CG}(N - \bar N_1, V_3, T)
\end{align}
or equivalently
\begin{align}\label{eqn:a-energy-1}
  A(N, V, T)
  \approx
  \bar N_1\omega_0 +
  A_{\AT}(\bar N_1, V_1, T) + A_{\CG}(N - \bar N_1, V_3, T)
\end{align}
Where $A$ denotes the Helmholtz free energy. 
At this point, the crucial question is if the condition $\ln N \ll \ln \tilde q_{\bar N_1}$
holds, or equivalently
\begin{align}\label{eqn:condition}
  \ln N 
  \ll
  -\beta \bar N_1\omega_0 +
  \ln Q_{\AT}(\bar N_1, V_1, T) + \ln Q_{\CG}(N - \bar N_1, V_3, T)
\end{align}
Generally this is true: $\ln Q_{\CG}(N - \bar N_1, V_3, T)$
is proportional to the free energy $A_{\CG}(N - \bar N_1, V_3, T)$,
which is an extensive thermodynamic variable, so
$A_{\CG}(N - \bar N_1, V_3, T)$ is proportional to $N-\bar N_1$.
Due to the thermodynamic limit $N \gg \bar N_1$,
$A_{\CG}(N - \bar N_1, V_3, T)$ is actually proportional $N$, which
is much larger than $\ln N$ under thermodynamic limit; this
validates condition~\eqref{eqn:condition}.
We will see later (from Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:pn1})
that the maximum $\bar N_1$ corresponds to the maximum
value of probability $p(N_1)$; this is also the average molecule
number in the AT region that is of statistical importance
under the thermodynamic limit.  Since $\bar
N_1$ is the maximum, by differentiating on the right hand side of
Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:a-energy-1}, we have the relation:
\begin{align}
  \omega_0 = \mu_{\CG}(N - \bar N_1, V_3, T)  - \mu_{\AT}(\bar N_1, V_1, T)
\end{align}
This means that the difference in the chemical potential between the AT and CG
regions is taken care by the work of the filter.
Now, if the thermodynamic force of Eq.\ref{thf} ensures an
equilibrium that is the same as the full atomistic reference system,
the related work produced by the thermodynamic force is nothing else than $\omega_0 $.
In turn, this implies that the thermodynamic force assures the balance between the chemical potentials of the AT and CG resolution,
namely:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:w-mu-diff}
  \omega_0 = \mu_{\CG}(\rho_0V_3, V_3, T) - \mu_{AT}(\rho_0 V_1, V_1, T)
\end{align}
$\rho_0$ is the number density at which the atomistic and coarse-grained
resolutions should match,
namely $\bar N_1 = \rho_0V_1$ and $N - \bar N_1 = \rho_0(V - V_1)$ should apply.
Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:w-mu-diff} is a necessary
condition for the thermodynamic force that ensures
the correct equilibrium of the AT and CG regions.\\

\noindent
On the other hand, if we translate from the language of Helmholtz free
energy into that of the grand potential, we have that
under the thermodynamic limit, they are the same.
Next, assuming the system reaches an
equilibrium of flat density profile of $\rho_0$ all over the AdResS simulation box, 
Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:a-energy-1} becomes:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:g-energy-1}
  G(\mu, V, T) \approx
  \rho_0V_1\omega_0
  + G_{\AT}(\mu_{\AT}, V_1, T) + G_{\CG}(\mu_{\CG}, V - V_1, T)
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  G(\mu, V, T) = A(N, V, T) - \mu_{\AT} \bar N_1 - \mu_{\CG}(N - \bar N_1)
\end{align}
Because of the equilibrium situation, the derivative of r.h.s. of
Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:g-energy-1} with respect to atomistic volume $V_1$
should vanishes (the same argument as the Helmholtz free energy):
\begin{align}
  \rho_0\omega_0 = -p_{\AT}+p_{\CG} \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
  p_{\AT} + \rho_0\omega_0 = p_{\CG}
\end{align}
which is exactly the definition of the thermodynamic force.
The argument in this section is based on the fact that $\bar N_{1}$, rather than $N_{1}$ can be considered as representative of the configuration realizations in the AT region. This implies that the particle fluctuations, $\Delta N_{1}$,
are negligible (compared to $\bar N_{1}$) in the AT region. This hypothesis is valid if the AT region is large enough so that $\bar N_{1}$ is large. This point seems to be true in all numerical experiments done so far (see e.g. Ref.\cite{debash}). In this way, we have shown the formal derivation of the thermodynamic force as a tool to balance the chemical potential between the two regions. For a Grand Canonical-like set up, the balance of chemical potential between open regions is a necessary condition to have the exchange of molecules in thermodynamic equilibrium and as a consequence we have formally justified why Eq.\ref{thf} is a necessary condition for AdResS to be considered an effective Grand Canonical set up.


\subsection{The number probability $p(N_1)$}
\label{sec:pn1}
In this section, we provide the basic arguments by which one can define at which level of approximation $p(N_{1})$
in AdResS is the same as in a full atomistic simulation. This is an important point
in order to justify the reliability of AdResS as a Grand
Canonical set up in terms of probability distribution. In fact if
$p(N_{1})$ in AdResS is very different from the corresponding one of a
full atomistic simulation, then clearly the AdResS method cannot be
considered valid since the artifacts due to the
different $p(N_{1})$ would give a non realistic description of the
system.
Essentially the arguments of this equivalence are two; for the the 1st order accuracy of  $p(N_{1})$,
the system should have matched chemical potential, i.e.
\begin{align}\label{eqn:mu-eq}
  \mu_{\CG} &= \mu_{\AT} + \omega_0
\end{align}
This has been shown in the previous section for the thermodynamic limit. 
Whether the size of standard and feasible molecular simulations can be considered, effectively, in the thermodynamic limit will be checked later on with numerical tests; however we can anticipate that the answer is positive for systems whose size and time of simulation are nowadays routinely done.
For the 2nd order of accuracy, one needs to match the compressibility:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:kappa-eq}
  \kappa_{\CG} &= \kappa_{\AT}.
\end{align}
Eq.\ref{eqn:kappa-eq} implies that the center of mass-center of mass radial distribution functions of the atomistic and coarse-grained region are matched \cite{han}.
Essentially these are the physical requirements to show that up to the second order $p(N_1)$ in AdResS is the same as in the equivalent subregion of the full atomistic system of reference.
Because of the lengthy arguments, specific details are reported in Appendix~\ref{app:2}.

  \label{fig:tmp2b}
\end{figure}
The arguments we have used so far are not sufficient to infer that the probability $p(\vect x_1 , N_1)$,
as presented in the theoretical analysis, corresponds to that of a Grand Canonical distribution  (Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:p}).
One must be very careful about any statement on $p(\vect x_1, N_1)$ 
due to the following three reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Boltzmann form of the distribution $p(\vect x_1|N_1; \vect x_2, N_2)$
is in this case only an approximation.
\item Conditions \eqref{eqn:p-1-cond1} and \eqref{eqn:p-1-cond2}
are only necessary, and are in general not sufficient to guarantee
the correct distribution $p(\vect x_2, N_2 | N_1)$ in the hybrid region $\HY$.
\item The particle number distribution $p(N_1)$ , from the conceptual point of view, can be correct only up to the second order.
\end{enumerate}
However, the number distribution $p(N_1)$ has already
been proved to be numerically correct in Ref.~\cite{prlgc, rdfcorr} for the relevant case of liquid water. In this section, we want to test, with a numerical simulation, to what extent, other quantities, e.g. the configurational distribution $p(\vect x_1) = \sum_{N_1}p(\vect x_1, N_1)$, are correct . 
Obviously it is a prohibitive task for any complex molecular system to determine the high-dimensional configurational distribution,
so, instead, we study its marginal distribution up to the third order.
Here we report the H-O and H-H RDFs (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2a}), and the 3-body COM
RDF $g^{(3)}(\vect r_1, \vect r_2, \vect r_2)$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2b}). For simulation
protocols and the definition of 3-body RDF, see the Appendix.
The first order marginal distribution, that is the molecular density profile and the second order marginal distribution, that is the COM RDF are not presented here, we address the readers to Ref.~\cite{rdfcorr}. 
Here we focus on the more delicate RDFs which involve the atomistic accuracy, and on the third order COM three-body distribution ($g^{3}$). From Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2a} one can see that
the AdResS H-O and H-H RDFs are identical to those of 
the full atomistic reference system in the AT region.
Interestingly, despite the corrective force of the RFD is applied only to the COM RDF, also in the region HY I (that is close to the atomistic region) the H-O and H-H RDFs are the same as in the full atomistic case.
This implies that the AT region
is embedded in an environment where not only the COM-COM structural properties but also finer structural
properties are the same as for the atomistic resolution.
In the HY II and III regions, the AdResS results obviously deviate from those
of the full atomistic reference system, because the atomistic nature 
is decreasing as a molecule travels from HY I to HY III, so it must be expected 
that the orientational order is also fading away. In HY III, the H-O and H-H
RDFs are actually structureless.
Furthermore, we test the 3-body COM RDF in Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2b} (for the definition of the three-body COM RDF see Appendix~\ref{app:tmp1}).
Interestingly, the three -body correlation is correctly reproduced
by the AdResS in the AT and HY I  regions. This is a further strong argument in favor of the fact that in AdResS the AT region is embedded in an environment that, at least up to the three-body COM correlation is the same as the full atomistic reference system.
In the HY II and HY III regions, the three-body correlation deviates from the
full atomistic reference, when the first two molecules are near (the first
two columns). This means that reproducing only two-body COM RDF \emph{does not}
lead to the correct reproduction of the three-body COM RDF.
Another important information of Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2a} and \ref{fig:tmp2b},
is that the hypothesis of short-range influence of a region over another employed in Eq.\ref{eqn:p-1-1} is numerically justified and thus we can state that for the case of liquid water at ambient conditions the AT region is only short-range
correlated with the rest of the system.



\section{WCA potential instead of atomistic-based coarse-grained potential: Coupling the atomistic region to a generic source of energy and particles}
The numerical test presented in the previous section shows how an atomistic model and its corresponding coarse-grained model, which resemble basic structural properties of the original full atomistic system, can be interfaced in an adaptive way and exchange molecules in a Grand Canonical fashion. However one may be induced to think that the request of having a coarse-grained model which resembles as much as possible the structural and thermodynamic properties of a full atomistic model would be a necessary condition to have a proper exchange of particles between the different regions. If it was so, the idea of the adaptive scheme as a Grand Canonical tool would not be very general; our theoretical results instead suggest that it must be sufficient to impose some given conditions in the transition region to have a proper exchange of energy and particles between the small atomistic region and the large coarse-grained reservoir. 
This means that if the theoretical considerations are correct, one should be able to show numerically that the proper exchange of energy and molecules is independent from the molecular model used in the coarse-grained region; that is, the filter of the transition region makes the atomistic region a Grand Canonical ensemble. For this reason we have carried on a further numerical test where the molecules in the coarse-grained region interact with a generic WCA potential which assures that only the density, but not the radial distribution function, of a liquid governed by this potential is the same as that of the liquid water( for the simulation set up see the Appendix).

  The left plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:wca-den} shows that
  the density profile of the
  WCA AdResS is perfectly matching the all-atom reference system; satisfying agreement is found also in the AT and HY I regions of the right plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:wca-den} which shows the molecular
  number fluctuation over the whole system.
  Fig.~\ref{fig:wca-dist} shows several distributions of the WCA AdResS
  in the atomistic region. The first two plots report
  the COM-COM, H-O and H-H RDFs. It must be noticed that in this case, on purpose, we want to investigate a {\it ``worst case scenario''} and thus we did not apply the RDF corrective force in the transition region. This means that the RDFs in the
  $\Delta$ region are not very accurate and, according to the theory developed in previous sections, one may not have good agreement for the considered RDFs, in the atomistic region. However, results show that the
  WCA RDFs are nonetheless very accurate (within the width of the lines). This means that, from the numerical point of view, even only the work of the thermodynamic force, by allowing an exchange of particles under conditions of equilibrium of the chemical potential, is sufficient to assure the correct equilibrium of the atomistic region. The possible application of the corrective force on the RDF's in $\Delta$ in the case of liquid water is, in this case, numerically not required, but in case of necessity it would anyway represent a systematic tool for improving accuracy. 
  Finally, figure~\ref{fig:wca-g3} compares the 3-body correlation $g^3$
  with the atomistic reference
  system (see the first line of Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp2b}), and plots the difference.
  It shows that the $g^3$ in the atomistic region is essentially the same of the reference all atom simulation, thus a further numerically satisfying proof of accuracy assured by the filter of the transition region.
In the context of this work, results reported in Figs.~\ref{fig:wca-den}, \ref{fig:wca-dist} and \ref{fig:wca-g3} show that in the atomistic region the accuracy at the second order and particle number fluctuations, for which the filter in the transition region is designed, are well preserved; that is the atomistic region exchange particle and energy with the reservoir in a proper Grand Canonical fashion (up to the level of approximation decided {\it a priori}). Being the molecules in the coarse-grained region a generic liquid model, we have proved numerically that indeed the adaptive technique employed here can be considered as a tool for general Grand Canonical Molecular Dynamics simulations.  




\section{Conclusions}
We have shown a detailed theoretical analysis about the validity, the limitations and meaning of the AdResS method within the framework of a Grand Canonical ensemble. Using strict formal arguments, we have interpreted the thermodynamic force, which in the original AdResS was derived in an empirical way, as a tool to balance the difference in chemical potential due to the different resolutions in space. Finally, we have shown that, under given hypothesis, $p(N_{1})$, the probability distribution in the atomistic region of AdResS is equivalent to that in the same region in a full atomistic simulation, up to the accuracy of a second order expansion. We have further strengthen our hypothesis and conclusions by carrying on a numerical experiment for the case of liquid water at ambient conditions where we could even go beyond the COM RDF. 
A further numerical experiment was made where the atomistic-based coarse-grained model was substituted by a generic liquid of spheres interacting via WCA potential. Results show that the accuracy in the atomistic region is the same as that of AdResS based on a coarse-grained model derived from the full atomistic reference system; this strengthen the idea of AdResS as a tool for coupling the atomistic region to a generic source of energy and particles in a Grand Canonical manner.
In conclusion, these results provide a solid theoretical basis to explain the numerical reliability of the AdResS as an effective Grand Canonical set up and provide basis for further formal and numerical development of the adaptive idea in terms of matching probability distributions.

\section{The number probability $p(N_1)$}\label{app:2}
In this section, we define at which level of approximation $p(N_{1})$, in AdResS is the same as in a full atomistic simulation. 
Let us consider the marginal distribution $p(N_1)$
\begin{align}\nonumber
  p(N_1)
  &=
  \frac{N!}{N_1!N_3!}
  \int
  \dd d\vect x_1\dd d\vect x_3  \:
  \frac{1}{Q(N,V,T) N!}
  e^{-\beta
    [\mathcal H_{N_1}^{\AT}(\vect x_1) +
    \mathcal H_{N_3}^{\CG}(\vect x_3) +
    N_1\omega_0]}\\\nonumber
  &=
  \frac{N!}{N_1!N_3!}
  \frac{N_1!N_3!}{Q(N,V,T) N!}
  e^{-\beta N_1\omega_0}
  \bigg[
  \frac1{N_1!}
  \int
  \dd d\vect x_1
  e^{-\beta \mathcal H_{N_1}^{\AT}(\vect x_1)}
  \bigg]
  \bigg[
  \frac1{N_3!}
  \int
  \dd d\vect x_3
  e^{-\beta \mathcal H_{N_3}^{\CG}(\vect x_3)}
  \bigg]  \\\label{eqn:pn1}
  &=
  \frac
  {
    e^{-\beta N_1\omega_0}
    Q_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T) Q_{\CG}(N-N_1,V_3,T)
  }
  {
    \sum_{n_1}
    e^{-\beta n_1\omega_0}
    Q_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T) Q_{\CG}(N-n_1,V_3,T)
  }
\end{align}
where $n_1$ is the summation variable that goes from 0 to $N$.
In any case, when $n_1$ is not much smaller than $N$ (i.e. out of the range of the
thermodynamic limit), the statistic is not relevant,
and can be safely neglected.
The marginal number distribution of the full atomistic simulation,
which the AdResS simulation should
reproduce is
\begin{align}
  p_{\AT}(N_1)
  &=
  \frac
  {
    Q_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T) Q_{\AT}(N-N_1,V_3,T)
  }
  {
    \sum_{n_1}
    Q_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T) Q_{\AT}(N-n_1,V_3,T)
  }  
\end{align}
We want to calculate the difference between $p(N_1)$ and $p_{\AT}(N_1)$; that is the difference between the particle probability in the atomistic region of AdResS ($p(N_{1})$), and the particle probability in a full atomistic simulation in the region equivalent to the AT region of AdResS.
In order to do so we proceed with the following technical operation: multiply the numerator of $p(N_1)$ by the denominator of
$p_{\AT}(N_1)$ (denoted by $T_1$),
and multiply the numerator of $p_{\AT}(N_1)$
by the denominator of $p(N_1)$ (denoted by $T_2$). It follows:
\begin{align}
  T_1
  &=
  e^{-\beta N_1\omega_0}
  Q_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T) Q_{\CG}(N-N_1,V_3,T)
  \times
  \sum_{n_1}
  Q_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T) Q_{\AT}(N-n_1,V_3,T)\\
  T_2
  &=
  Q_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T) Q_{\AT}(N-N_1,V_3,T)
  \times
  \sum_{n_1}
  e^{-\beta n_1\omega_0}
  Q_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T) Q_{\CG}(N-n_1,V_3,T)
\end{align}
The difference between $T_1$ and $T_2$ is basically the difference
between $p(N_1)$ and $p_{\AT}(N_1)$.
Calculating $T_1$:
\begin{align}\nonumber
  T_1
  &=
  \sum_{n_1}
  e^{-\beta N_1\omega_0}
  Q_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T)\,
  Q_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T)\,
  Q_{\AT}(N-n_1,V_3,T)\,
  Q_{\CG}(N-N_1,V_3,T) \\\label{eqn:t1-1}
  &=
  \sum_{n_1}
  \exp
  \big\{-\beta
  \big[
  \omega_0N_1 +
  A_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T) +
  A_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T) +
  A_{\AT}(N-n_1,V_3,T) +
  A_{\CG}(N-N_1,V_3,T)
  \big]
  \big\}
\end{align}
Since we work under the hypothesis that the atomistic region is much smaller than the whole system, it
is reasonable to assume $n_1 \ll N$ and $N_1\ll N$.
Notice the free energy is extensive.
Due to the Euler's theorem~\cite{tuckeman2010statistical},
we have
\begin{align}\label{eqn:Aat-0}
  A_{\AT}(N-n_1,V_3,T)
  &= V_3 A_{\AT}(\frac{N-n_1}{V_3},1,T)
  = V_3 A_{\AT}(\rho_0 + \frac{\hat N_1 - n_1}{V_3},1,T)\\\label{eqn:Acg-0}
  A_{\CG}(N-N_1,V_3,T)
  &= V_3 A_{\CG}(\frac{N-N_1}{V_3},1,T)
  = V_3 A_{\CG}(\rho_0 + \frac{\hat N_1 - N_1}{V_3},1,T),
\end{align}
where $\hat N_1$ is the number of molecules in the atomistic region
at the wished density $\rho_0$ of equilibrium, namely
$\hat N_1 = \rho_0V_1 = N - \rho_0 V_3$.
Notice, under the thermodynamic limit, $\hat N_1$ is equivalent to
$\bar N_1$.
$A_{\AT}(\rho_0 + (\hat N_1 - n_1)/{V_3},1,T)$ and
$A_{\CG}(\rho_0 + (\hat N_1 - N_1)/{V_3},1,T)$ are
the free energies per \emph{unit} volume, with
the density perturbed from $\rho_0$ by  $(\hat N_1 - n_1)/{V_3}$
and $(\hat N_1 - N_1)/{V_3}$, respectively.
These perturbations originate from the fluctuating
number of molecules in the atomistic region: when the number
deviates from $\hat N_1$, molecules enter into the coarse-grained
region and the density is perturbed.
Under the thermodynamic
limit, $\hat N_1$ is comparable to $n_1$ and $N_1$, and all of them are
supposed to be much much smaller than $N$ while $V_3$ is of the same order of magnitude of $V$ (the large CG region compared to the small AT region).
Since $\rho_0 = N/V$ always holds, the perturbations
$(\hat N_1 - n_1)/{V_3}$
and $(\hat N_1 - N_1)/{V_3}$ are small.
Therefore, we have the following
Taylor expansions of the free energies \eqref{eqn:Aat-0} and \eqref{eqn:Acg-0}
about $\rho_0$:
\begin{align}
  A_{\AT}(\rho_0 + \frac{\hat N_1 - n_1}{V_3},1,T)
  &= A_{\AT}(\rho_0,1,T)
  +\mu_{\AT}
  \Big(
  \frac{\hat N_1 - n_1}{V_3}
  \Big)
  +
  \frac1{2\rho_0^2\,\kappa_{\AT}}
  \Big(
  \frac{\hat N_1 - n_1}{V_3}
  \Big)^2
  + \textrm{h.o.t.} \\
  A_{\CG}(\rho_0 + \frac{\hat N_1 - N_1}{V_3},1,T)
  &= A_{\CG}(\rho_0,1,T)
  +\mu_{\CG}
  \Big(
  \frac{\hat N_1 - N_1}{V_3}
  \Big)
  +
  \frac1{2\rho_0^2\,\kappa_{\CG}}
  \Big(
  \frac{\hat N_1 - N_1}{V_3}
  \Big)^2
  + \textrm{h.o.t.} 
\end{align}
The ``h.o.t.'' stands for higher order terms (greater than 2)
of the density perturbation, which we neglect since they have been found numerically not relevant (see Ref.\cite{rdfcorr}).
By using the conditions \eqref{eqn:mu-eq} and \eqref{eqn:kappa-eq},
we have $T_1$
\begin{align}\nonumber
  T_1
  = \,&
  \sum_{n_1}
  \exp
  \Big\{-\beta
  \Big[
  A_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T) +
  A_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T) +
  A_{\AT}(\rho_0V_3,V_3,T) +
  A_{\CG}(\rho_0V_3,V_3,T) \\
  \,&+(\mu_\AT + \mu_\CG)\hat N_1
  -\mu_{\AT}\,(N_1 + n_1) +
  \frac{V_3}{2\rho_0\, \kappa_{\AT}}
  \Big[
  \Big(
  \frac{\hat N_1 - n_1}{V_3}
  \Big)^2
  +
  \Big(
  \frac{\hat N_1 - N_1}{V_3}
  \Big)^2
  \Big]
  +\textrm{h.o.t.}
  \Big]
  \Big\}
\end{align}
Similarly, we calculate $T_2$:
\begin{align}\nonumber
  T_2
  &=
  \sum_{n_1}
  e^{-\beta n_1\omega_0}
  Q_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T)\,
  Q_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T)\,
  Q_{\CG}(N-n_1,V_3,T)\,
  Q_{\AT}(N-N_1,V_3,T) \\\nonumber
  &=
  \sum_{n_1}
  \exp
  \big\{-\beta
  \big[
  \omega_0n_1 +
  A_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T) +
  A_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T) +
  A_{\CG}(N-n_1,V_3,T) +
  A_{\AT}(N-N_1,V_3,T)
  \big]
  \big\}
\end{align}
with similar expansions and by the conditions Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:mu-eq}
and \eqref{eqn:kappa-eq}, we have:
\begin{align}\nonumber
  T_2
  = \,&
  \sum_{n_1}
  \exp
  \Big\{-\beta
  \Big[
  A_{\AT}(n_1,V_1,T) +
  A_{\AT}(N_1,V_1,T) +
  A_{\AT}(\rho_0V_3,V_3,T) +
  A_{\CG}(\rho_0V_3,V_3,T) \\
  \,&+(\mu_\AT + \mu_\CG)\hat N_1
  -\mu_{\AT}\,(N_1 + n_1) +
  \frac{V_3}{2\rho_0\, \kappa_{\AT}}
  \Big[
  \Big(
  \frac{\hat N_1 - n_1}{V_3}
  \Big)^2
  +
  \Big(
  \frac{\hat N_1 - N_1}{V_3}
  \Big)^2
  \Big]
  +\textrm{h.o.t.}
  \Big]
  \Big\}
\end{align}
Comparing $T_1$ and $T_2$, one can easily see that they are equivalent (at least) to the second leading
order with respect to the density perturbations
$(\hat N_1 - n_1)/{V_3}$
and $(\hat N_1 - N_1)/{V_3}$.
Since the difference between the probabilities
$p(N_1)$ and $p_{\AT}(N_1)$ is basically the difference between $T_1$
and $T_2$, we conclude that $p(N_1)$ is a good approximation to
$p_{\AT}(N_1)$ to the second leading order. High orders, as anticipated before, seem numerically not relevant and anyway, at this stage, not easy to treat at formal level.


\section{Simulation protocols}
The testing system contained 3456 SPC/E \cite{berendsen1987missing}
water molecules in a $7.50\textsf{nm}\times 3.72\textsf{nm}\times
3.72\textsf{nm}$ periodic box. The system was divided along the $x$ direction
into one atomistic region of width $1.00\textsf{nm}$ and one
coarse-grained region of width $1.00\textsf{nm}$ connected by two
hybrid region of width $2.75\textsf{nm}$.
The hybrid region was equally divided into three sub-regions (with width $\sim 0.9\textsf{nm}$)
to calculate the local RDFs.
These sub-regions are called HY I, HY II and HY III, from the AT side to the CG resolution side.
The simulation was made at
room temperature of $300\textsf{K}$. The time step was $\Delta t =
0.002\textsf{ps}$. The cut-off radius $r_{c}$ used for all interactions was
$0.90\textsf{nm}$. The electrostatic interaction method used for the
atomistic region was the reaction field method. All simulations were
performed by MD simulation software Gromacs \cite{gromacs}
and VOTCA \cite{ruehle2009versatile}.
In the WCA-based simulation, the interaction potential between particles in the coarse-grained region is given by
\begin{align}
  U(r) = 4\varepsilon
  \big[
  \big(\frac\sigma r\big)^{12}
  -
  \big(\frac\sigma r\big)^{6}
  + \varepsilon
  \big]
  \qquad  r\leq \sigma^{1/6}
\end{align}
The parameters used in this study are $\varepsilon = 0.65$~\textsf{kJ/mol}
and $\sigma = 0.30$~\textsf{nm}. These parameters are chosen such that
the soft core of WCA is roughly the same as the structure-based coarse-grained
water model.
Other parameters used in the simulation are the
same as the standard AdResS.



\section{The details of the 3-body radial distribution function}
\label{app:tmp1}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{fig.grand/3mol.eps}
  \caption{The schematic plot of the 3-body RDF.}\label{fig:tmp3}
\end{figure}



The 3-body RDF is defined by
\begin{align}
  g^{(3)}(\vect r_1, \vect r_2, \vect r_3) =
  \frac{1}{\rho^3}N(N-1)(N-2) \,p^{(3)}(\vect r_1, \vect r_2, \vect r_3) 
\end{align}
where $p^{(3)}(\vect r_1, \vect r_2, \vect r_3) $ is the 3-body
probability distribution function. To plot this high-dimensional
distribution, we first fix the distance between molecule 1 and 2 (Mol
1 and 2 in Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3}), then plot the RDF $g^{(3)}$ with
respect to the position of the third molecule (Mol 3 in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3}).  The position of Mol 3 can be described by
the variables $h_1$ and $h_2$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3}, which are
the projection of Mol~3's position on the to the
axis defined by Mol 1 and 2, see Fig.~\ref{fig:tmp3}.
